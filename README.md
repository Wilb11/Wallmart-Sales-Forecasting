Walmart Sales Forecasting

This GitHub repository contains the analysis and findings from a project titled "Walmart Supply Chain Analysis: Analysis of Walmart Weekly Sales." The project delves into the factors influencing the weekly sales of 45 individual Walmart stores, aiming to identify strategies for revenue growth and improvement. Leveraging the "Walmart.csv" dataset sourced from Kaggle, the analysis initiates with meticulous data preparation, cleaning, and feature engineering processes. By calculating correlation coefficients and employing visualization techniques, the study reveals significant correlations between store size, product type, and weekly sales. Notably, variables such as 'Size', 'Type', and 'Size_type' exhibit the most substantial correlations with weekly sales. Furthermore, through K-means clustering analysis, specific departments contributing to sales are identified for each store, facilitating tailored strategies for revenue enhancement. The project culminates in the application of a RandomForestRegressor model to predict weekly sales, yielding promising results with a high R-squared value. The findings emphasize the importance of tailoring product categories to individual store characteristics, with specific recommendations provided for different store clusters. Overall, by implementing the suggested strategies, Walmart stores can expect to witness significant improvements in weekly sales and overall revenue.
